>> Try-Catch Keyword:  "Try" and "catch" are keywords that represent the handling of exceptions due to data or
   coding errors during program execution. A try block is the block of code in which exceptions occur.
   A catch block catches and handles try block exceptions.
   Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception.
   Java catch block is used to handle the Exception.

>> Throw Keyword:  The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code.
   The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exceptions.
